# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code and analysis for a diabetes prediction project. The project involves data collection, data cleaning, data visualization, data preprocessing, and the development and evaluation of several machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health-related features.

## Import Libraries <a id='import'>

In this section, we import the necessary libraries and modules for the project, including data analysis, visualization, and machine learning libraries.

## Data Collection and Statistical Analysis <a id='data-collection-and-statistical-analysis'>

Here, we load the dataset, display the first few rows, and perform a statistical analysis of the data. We also provide a summary of the columns in the dataset.

## Data Cleaning <a id='data-cleaning'>

We check for null values and handle duplicates in the dataset. Additionally, we inspect unique values in each column to ensure data quality.

## Data Visualization <a id='data-visualization'>

We use various visualizations to gain insights into the data. This includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate explorations, as well as heatmaps and parallel coordinate plots.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building machine learning models, we preprocess the data. This includes handling outliers, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and preparing the features and target variables.

## Machine Learning Models <a id='ml-models'>

We build and evaluate different machine learning models for diabetes prediction, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**

Hyperparameter tuning is performed for some models to improve their performance.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of diabetes prediction using machine learning. You can explore each section for details and findings related to the dataset and models.

Feel free to use this code and analysis for your own projects or research.
